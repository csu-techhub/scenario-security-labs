In this lab, participants engage in the simulation of the EternalBlue attack, a notorious exploit that capitalizes on the vulnerability within the SMBv1 protocol to propagate malware across networks. The figure provides a graphical overview of the scenario. Utilizing Kali Linux as the attacker’s platform and Windows 7 as the target system, the exercise begins with the acquisition and unpacking of ransomware from a specified URL, laying the groundwork for subsequent malicious activities. Leveraging the inherent weaknesses in Microsoft Window’s handling of specially crafted packets, participants exploit the EternalBlue vulnerability to establish a meterpreter session, gaining unauthorized access to the victim’s machine. Subsequently, the exploit is employed to transmit the ransomware to the victim’s system, initiating the encryption process for all accessible files.  

This scenario begins students’ introduction to incident response. With the readings assigned for this scenario, students learn critical components of an incident response, including background, planning, and execution. The readings reinforce that a security incident is often considered inevitable and that planning for such an incident is critical and must be cross-functional. Building off a cross-functional incident response, legal obligations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and data breach notification laws, are incorporated into this scenario.
