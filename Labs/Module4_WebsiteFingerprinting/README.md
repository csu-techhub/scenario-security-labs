In this lab, students simulate a website fingerprinting attack using k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) on a Kali Linux machine. The goal is to analyze traffic patterns such as packet lengths, frequency, and timing to identify visits to blacklisted websites. Students conduct 15 browsing sessions for each site, capturing traffic data from seven websites using the Lynx browser. The data is generated by a tcpdump for each website visit and used to train a kNN classifier to determine whether a user is accessing any of the blacklisted websites by analyzing distinct patterns of web traffic. The figure shows the setup for this scenario. A case study from the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCE) reinforces this lesson by giving a real-world example of censorship and discussing the right to secure Internet access and privacy.
