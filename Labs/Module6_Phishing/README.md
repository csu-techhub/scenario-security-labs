This scenario, outlined in the figure, simulates a phishing attack using the Zphisher tool on a Kali Linux machine, where a deceptive webpage mimicking popular websites such as Facebook or Instagram—is created. Victims on aWindows machine interact with the phishing link, and any entered credentials are captured and displayed on the attacker’s terminal. The lab also demonstrates how to make the phishing page accessible online using ngrok, allowing real-time capture of the victim’s credentials. As part of the legal reading paired with this scenario, students read the original complaint filed by Microsoft against Thallium, giving them the cybersecurity and legal background of a high-profile real-world example.  

Note that we use Ohio Cyber Range VM-based cybersecurity sandbox environment to ensure safety and compliance. All offensive security exercises, including Scenario 6 using Zphisher and ngrok, are conducted within a controlled virtual environment disconnected from the public internet. Outbound traffic was restricted, and the captured data contained only dummy credentials generated for instructional purposes. No live systems or real users were targeted.
