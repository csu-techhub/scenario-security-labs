As shown in Figure 5, this lab experiment explores security vulnerabilities in PBX administrative systems by focusing on the risk posed by weak passwords. While threats like firewall bypasses and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Free PBX exist, the primary goal is to emphasize the dangers of inadequate password security. The setup involves three machines: a Linux machine as the PBX hub, a Windows machine for PBX configuration, and a Kali Linux machine for probing the system. Using Kali Linux, the attacker intercepts HTTP requests between the PBX and Windows and employs Hydra, a password-cracking tool, to access the admin panel, highlighting the need for strong password protections.  

The readings assigned for this scenario introduce students to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Through case studies where individuals were charged with violating the CFAA, students gain a fundamental understanding of what constitutes a cyber crime and the legal implications that follow. Other concepts discussed in this scenario are wire fraud and identity fraud.
