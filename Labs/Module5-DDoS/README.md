In this scenario, a DDoS attack, shown in the figure, is simulated using Kali Linux andWindows operating systems. Our attackers will be Kali Linux andWindows 7 (functioning as a bot for Kali Linux), targeting aWindows XP machine. The attacker compromises vulnerable hosts, turning them into “bots” via techniques such as simple password guessing or by exploiting vulnerabilities such as EternalBlue. Once compromised, those bots are directed to generate high-volume traffic aimed at the victim, overwhelming its network and services. We exploit the server message block (SMBv1) vulnerability, injecting data packets into the network. The main goal is to simulate and observe the network traffic on Windows XP, achieved through a blend of scripting, Metasploit, and external tools.
