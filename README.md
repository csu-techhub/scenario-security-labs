## 📘 Overview
This repository contains materials from the **Scenario-Based Cybersecurity Laboratory Series**, a course collaboratively developed between **Engineering and Law** programs at Cleveland State University.  
The course, named as **Hack Lab**, immerses students in **realistic cyber-attack and defense scenarios** while simultaneously addressing the **legal, ethical, and policy implications** of each incident.

The goal is to bridge the gap between **technical cyber defense** and **cyber law practice**, cultivating cross-disciplinary professionals capable of identifying, analyzing, and responding to incidents in compliance with both security standards and legal frameworks.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
After completing these modules, participants will be able to:
1. Conduct technical analysis of simulated attacks such as DDoS, phishing, and ransomware using open-source tools.  
2. Apply digital forensic principles to collect, preserve, and analyze evidence in line with legal requirements.  
3. Evaluate incident scenarios through the lenses of **policy, regulation, and liability**.  
4. Collaboratively develop incident response reports integrating technical mitigation and legal justification.  
5. Explain how organizational governance, privacy laws, and regulatory frameworks shape cyber defense operations.

## 🧾 Course Implementation Example
This lab series has been offered as a semester-long **Hack Lab** course for both **Computer Science (CS)** and **Law** students at CSU (Spring 2024 and Spring 2025).  
By semester’s end, students reported a **+2.8 average gain** in confidence across four competencies (Identify vulnerabilities; Apply cybersecurity laws; Incident response steps; Organizational preparation).  
Overall course evaluation: **4.5 (CS)** and **4.0 (Law)** on a 5-point scale.
