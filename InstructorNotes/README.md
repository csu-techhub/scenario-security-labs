We piloted these learning modules as a semester-long course titled as “Hack Lab” for both Computer Science (CS) and Law students at CSU during Spring 2024 and Spring 2025. According to the self-assessment survey by the end of the semester, students demonstrated substantial gains in confidence across four key competencies (identifying vulnerabilities and using tools, applying cybersecurity laws, recognizing steps in incident response, and explaining organizational response preparation) with an average improvement of +2.8 on a 1–5 scale.  

The largest gains among CS students (the first figure) were in incident response process understanding and organizational preparation, areas that were least familiar before the course. Their definitions of “hacking” evolved from a narrow focus on “unauthorized access” to a more nuanced understanding involving ethical hacking, system protection, and legal awareness. For Law students (the second figure), the strongest Improvement were in understanding of technical and organizational response improved the most (+3.0). Students shifted from little to no technical familiarity to being able to describe and interpret exploit patterns, e.g., EternalBlue or Spectre.
