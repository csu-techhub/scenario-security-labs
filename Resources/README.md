A hands-on approach of security training and education are not typically available for students. In our experience, students not only like to have hands-on experience of security issues by hacking a system, but also they learn the issues and corresponding protection much better with practical experience. To this end, it is important to design specially-crafted set of experiments with virtual machine (VM)-based platforms. NICE Challenge Project and Defcon’s Capture the Flag are similar examples but they focus only on technical challenges. We employ Ohio Cyber Range VM environment, where students not only perform technical analyses and mitigations but also examine the legal implications and compliance requirements of the incidents. This integrated approach ensures thorough, hands-on skills development while simultaneously grounding students in the theoretical context of cybersecurity.
